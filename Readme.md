Note:
This is a simple test example I implemented for 2d Freeform blend trees in Unity3D. 
The characters is used from standard asset with Idle, Walk & Run cycles of different types.
The controls are supported in Xbox & PC as well. Building the same controls to Any smartphones will require some cross platform input but doable.
Controls:
Keyboard:
	UP		:	W
	Down	:	S
	Left	:	A
	Right	:	D
